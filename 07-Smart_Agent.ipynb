    "- **Notebook 03**: We added AzureOpenAI GPT models to enhance the the production of the answer bu using Utility Chains of LLMs\n",
    "- **Notebook 04**: We added memory to our system in order to power a conversational Chat Bot\n",
    "- **Notebook 05**: We introduced Agents and Tools in order to be able to solve a more complex task: ask questions to Tabular datasets\n",
    "- **Notebook 06**: We used a Utility Chain in order to talk to a SQL Database directly\n",

Other risk factors include high body mass index, high breathing rate, exposure to the virus, diarrhea, chronic kidney disease, elevated myoglobin, elevated white blood cell and C-reactive protein. Laboratory indicators of COVID-19 include lymphopenia, eosinopenia, lactate dehydrogenase, procalcitonin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6), and ferritin. Elevated D-dimer, IL-6, and IL-10 levels are also risk factors for the progression of disease severity. Lower CD3, CD4, or CD19 counts are associated with disease deterioration and death. \n",
